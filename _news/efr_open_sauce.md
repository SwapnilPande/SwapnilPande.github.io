We demoed our viral EtchBot at OpenSauce 2024! We went through some serious design revisions to improve the robustness and serviceability of the hardware. Each Etchbot ran over 800 demos, with only routine servicing. We quickly discovered that the Etch-a-sketches were the weak link in the system, with a service life of about 400 demos :).

We also redesigned almost all of the software stack to better support live demos. This included building a GUI to capture a picture and show the users the pipeline proessing steps, retuning the piepline to better capture facial features, and reducing the processing time from ~8 minutes to under 50 seconds.
