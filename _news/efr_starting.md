Every Flavor was born out of frustration with the state of open-source robotics. Academic research often stalls on fragile, half-finished tools that blur the line between negative scientific results and poor engineering. Industry, meanwhile, sidesteps these problems by building expensive proprietary stacks - solving them privately instead of improving the shared foundation. The result is a tragedy: the open-source tools that drive innovation remain underfunded and underdeveloped.

Yet these tools, ROS, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OMPL, are the backbone of modern robotics. They let researchers focus on discovery rather than rebuilding infrastructure. PyTorch in particular shows whatâ€™s possible: a common language for machine learning that accelerates collaboration, shortens onboarding, and compounds innovation across labs and industries.

Our mission was to find a way to fund that same level of craftsmanship in open-source robotics. The answer came from an unlikely place: YouTube. Modern content creators have turned education and storytelling into full-fledged businesses, generating tens of millions in revenue while building communities around shared curiosity. We realized we could do the same for robotics: use storytelling to inspire and educate, and use that audience to fund serious open-source development.

Every Flavor set out to build an ecosystem of transparent, high-quality robotics tools, from embedded control and sensing to full-stack software, that empower anyone to create exceptional robots. Our belief was simple: education and open access are the fastest ways to move the entire field forward.
