Welcome! I'm Swapnil, I'm a robotics researcher and engineer interested in pushing the boundaries of robotic reasoning.

I received my Master's degree in Robotics, researching at the <a href="https://autonlab.org/">Auton Lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/">Jeff Schneider</a> and in collaboration with Argo AI. I studied methods for learning effective decision-making for autonomous vehicles from fully offline datasets and experimented with deploying these algorithms on Argo AI's driving stack.
